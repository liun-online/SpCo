# Usage
First, go into the target folder. Then, run the following commands:
```
# DGI+SpCo
python execute.py cora --gpu=0

# GRACE+SpCo
python train.py cora --gpu_id=0

# CCA+SpCo
python main.py cora --gpu 0
```
where "cora" can be replaced by {citeseer, blog, flickr, pubmed}. \
For each target model, we just add our SpCo on original code with some adaption. Therefore, you can refer to original code for better understanding about our code.
